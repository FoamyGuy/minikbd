# MiniKbd Software — Volume Control

For use with the “Two Rotary Encoders” build variation. One knob advances the track forward and back, the other knob adjusts the volume. 

On the Mac, turning the volume knob slowly increments the level with fine-grained control, the equivalent of holding down the “Option” key while pressing the volume keys on the keyboard. A quick turn increments the volume at a faster rate.

Pressing either knob will send the “Play/Pause” keystroke.
