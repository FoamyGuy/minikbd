# MiniKbd Hardware

![minikbd-oshpark-front](/images/minikbd-oshpark-front.png)

The MiniKbd is designed to be built in one of three configurations:

- “Six keyboard keyswitches”
- “Two rotary encoders”
- “One rotary encoder and two keyboard keyswitches”

## Buying it
Build one yourself! A batch of MiniKbd circuit boards is currently being made and once they've arrived in mid-April I'll have some for sale for around $6 each. Then, you can collect the parts listed below and build your own (or all three!)
