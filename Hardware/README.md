![minikbd-oshpark-front](/images/minikbd-oshpark-front.png)

The MiniKbd is designed to be built in one of three configurations:

- “Six keyboard keyswitches”
- “Two rotary encoders”
- “One rotary encoder and two keyboard keyswitches”

## Buying it
Build one yourself! A batch of MiniKbd circuit boards has been made, and they're available for sale at $6 each. [Contact me directly](http://www.andyclymer.com) if you'd like one!

## Parts List
The full list of parts for each of the three configurations along with a buying guide can be found in the [Parts List](./PartsList.md) file in this directory.

## Building it
Build guides are available for all three configurations:
- [Build Doc — Six Keyboard Keyswitches](./Build-SixKeyswitches.md)
- [Build Doc — Two Rotary Encoders](./Build-TwoEncoders.md)
- [Build Doc — One Rotary Encoder and Two Keyboard Keyswitches](./Build-OneEncoderTwoSwitches.md)

## MiniKbd Enclosure
A very simple laser cut enclosure can be made with the plans in the [Enclosure](./Enclosure) directory. Files are available to send for laser cutting at Ponoko if you don't have access to your own laser cutter.
