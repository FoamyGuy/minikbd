## Enclosure

The enclosure consists of a variety of pieces, all of which are optional or can be substituted as desired:
- Laser cut parts from acrylic sheet (from the PDF in this directory)
- 4 × 8mm long M3 sized standoffs
- 9 × M3x6mm screws
- 1 × M3 nut
- 5 × M3x1mm washers
- 4 × rubber bumper feet

The MiniKbd doesn't need to be built in an enclosure, but at minumum I would highly suggest at least getting a set of small rubber bumper feet for the bottom so that it stays put and doesn't scratch up your desk. [Adafruit has a set of four](https://www.adafruit.com/product/550) if you're already ordering from them, as well as [Kiwi Electronics](https://www.kiwi-electronics.nl/siliconen-voetjes-voor-behuizingen-4-stuks) in The Netherlands, but I prefer the [3M SJ5312 Bumpon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NG60SW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) because they're very small and grippy.

For the enclosure, I've laser cut parts in 1/8 inch (3mm) acrylic sheet, which can be avaialble from many sources. Files are available in the Enclosure folder of the repo. You won't want to completely obscure the LEDs on the top of the Trinket so I would recommend translucent acrylic if available. I like using the [Frosted Satin Ice](https://www.canalplastic.com/collections/plexi-sheets/products/0d010-df-frosted-satin-ice-acrylic-sheet?variant=32918342606) that I buy at Canal Plastics in NYC, but I would encourage you to look for local options. Laser cutting might also be able to be ordered from [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/).

Amazon and Ebay seem to be good places to buy a variety of standoffs and screws at a resonable price, I use the [white Nylon m3 standoff assortment](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DK3905Y/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which is also available in [black](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E8JZWZ6/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_14?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A1Z1DJFHECM1GS), along with a small set of [M3 1mm nylon washers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N45UFLG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). You can go nuts and get the same [stainless hex screws](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M3SFIAZ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that I used for the top four screws of the enclosure.
