## Enclosure

The MiniKbd doesn't need to be built in an enclosure, but at minumum I would highly suggest at least getting a set of small rubber bumper feet for the bottom so that it stays put and doesn't scratch up your desk. [Adafruit has a set of four](https://www.adafruit.com/product/550) if you're already ordering from them, as well as [Kiwi Electronics](https://www.kiwi-electronics.nl/siliconen-voetjes-voor-behuizingen-4-stuks) in The Netherlands, but I prefer the [3M SJ5312 Bumpon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NG60SW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) because they're very small and grippy.

For the enclosure, I've laser cut parts in 1/8 inch (3mm) acrylic sheet, which can be avaialble from many sources. Files are available this directory. You won't want to completely obscure the LEDs on the top of the Trinket so I would recommend translucent acrylic if available. I like using the [Frosted Satin Ice](https://www.canalplastic.com/collections/plexi-sheets/products/0d010-df-frosted-satin-ice-acrylic-sheet?variant=32918342606) that I buy at Canal Plastics in NYC, but I would encourage you to look for local options. Laser cutting might also be able to be ordered from [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/).

In addition to the laser cut acrylic parts and the rubber bumper feet, you will also need:
- 4 × 8mm long M3 sized standoffs
- 9 × M3x6mm screws
- 1 × M3 nut
- 5 × M3x1mm washers

Amazon and Ebay seem to be good places to buy these parts resonable price, I bought the [white Nylon m3 standoff assortment](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DK3905Y/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which is also available in [black](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E8JZWZ6/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_14?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A1Z1DJFHECM1GS), along with a small set of [M3 1mm nylon washers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N45UFLG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). You can go nuts and get the same [stainless hex screws](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M3SFIAZ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that I used for the top four screws of the enclosure.
